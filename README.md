# curl-fuzzer

Code and corpora for curl and libcurl fuzzing.

## I just want to get fuzzing!

Great! Run `./mainline.sh`. It will download you a fresh copy of curl, compile
it with `clang`, install it to a temporary directory, then compile the fuzzer
against curl. It'll also run the regression testcases.

If you have a local copy of curl that you want to use instead, pass the path as
an argument to `./mainline.sh`. It will compile and install that curl to a
temporary directory instead.

`./mainline.sh` is run regressibly by Travis CI.

## I want to find the code coverage from the testcases

Run `./codecoverage.sh`. It will download you a fresh copy of curl, compile it
with `gcc`, install it, then compile the fuzzer against it. It'll then run a
coverage run and work out the coverage of the test cases, using `lcov` to
generate coverage information.

`./codecoverage.sh` is run regressibly by Travis CI.

## I want more information when running a testcase or multiple testcases

Setting the `FUZZ_VERBOSE` environment variable turns on curl verbose logging.
This can be useful when debugging a single testcase.

## I want to reproduce an error hit overnight by OSS-Fuzz

Check out [REPRODUCING.md](REPRODUCING.md) for more detailed instructions.

## What's in this testcase?

To look at the contents of a testcase, run
```
python read_corpus.py --input <path/to/file>
```
This will print out a list of contents inside the file.

## I want to generate a new testcase

To generate a new testcase, run `python generate_corpus.py` with appropriate
options.

# I want to enhance the fuzzer!

Wonderful! Here's a bit of information you may need to know.

## File format

Testcases are written in a Type-Length-Value or TLV format. Each TLV has:

- 16 bits for the Type
- 32 bits for the Length of the TLV data
- 0 - length bytes of data.

TLV type numbers are defined in both corpus.py and curl_fuzzer.h.

## Adding a new TLV.

To add a new TLV:

- Add support for it in the Python scripts: `generate_corpus.py`, `corpus.py`.
  This means adding options for reading the value of the TLV from the user (or
  from a file, or from test data)
- Add support for it in the fuzzer: `curl_fuzzer.cc`, `curl_fuzzer.h`. This
  likely means adding handling of the TLV to `fuzz_parse_tlv()`.
